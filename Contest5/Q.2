Shuffle Hashing

Polycarp has built his own web service. Being a modern web service it includes login feature. And that always implies password security problems.

Polycarp decided to store the hash of the password, generated by the following algorithm:

1. take the password 𝑝, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and shuffle the letters randomly in it to obtain 𝑝′ (𝑝′ can still be equal to 𝑝);
2. generate two random strings, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 (any of these strings can be empty);
3. the resulting hash ℎ=𝑠1+𝑝′+𝑠2, where addition is string concatenation.

For example, let the password 𝑝= "abacaba". Then 𝑝′ can be equal to "aabcaab". Random strings 𝑠1= "zyx" and 𝑠2= "kjh". Then ℎ= "zyxaabcaabkjh".
Note that no letters could be deleted or added to 𝑝 to obtain 𝑝′, only the order could be changed.
Now Polycarp asks you to help him to implement the password check module. Given the password 𝑝 and the hash ℎ, check that ℎ can be the hash for the password 𝑝.
Your program should answer 𝑡 independent test cases.
